Objective
    Summary: 
        This program will allow the user to play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.
    To-do list: 
        We will create code that checks who won each round
        We will create code that takes input(choices) from the user
        We will create code that takes ‘input’(choices) from the computer 
        We will create code that checks if the user wants to quit, or if the user doesn’t enter one of the options(rock, paper, or scissors)
        We will loop each round of the game
        We will add statements at the end and the beginning that welcome and thank the user playing
        We will loop the whole game, so that the user can keep playing until they choose to quit

#set variable keepPlaying to true
#While keepPlaying is true:

    #print statement welcoming players to the game
    #print statement stating the rules (best out of 3 press 'q' to quit)
    
    #make a key that assigns a number to each choice for the computer 
    #(rock is 1, scissors is 2, paper is 3)

    #set computer's score to 0
    #set player's score to 0
